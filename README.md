[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## 🎯 Vision

Repstack is an open source alternative to commercial hypertrophy training applications, inspired by evidence-based training principles from Renaissance Periodization. Our mission is to make scientifically-backed muscle building programs accessible to everyone, completely free.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- **Open Source & Free**: Core functionality will always remain free and open source
- **Progressive Web App**: Runs seamlessly on all platforms (iOS, Android, Desktop, Web)
- **Science-Based**: Built on proven hypertrophy training principles
- **Privacy-First**: Your training data stays with you - works offline
- **Community-Driven**: Built by lifters, for lifters

## ✨ Planned Features

### Phase 1: Core Training Engine
- [ ] Personalized training program generator
- [ ] Auto-regulation based on user feedback (pump, soreness, recovery)
- [ ] Progressive overload tracking
- [ ] Mesocycle management (4-6 week training blocks)
- [ ] Deload week scheduling
- [ ] Exercise library with video demonstrations

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience
- [ ] Workout logging and history
- [ ] Progress tracking and analytics
- [ ] Custom exercise creation
- [ ] Template library (45+ pre-built programs)
- [ ] Exercise substitution recommendations
- [ ] Volume landmarks and recovery indicators

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Offline-first PWA capabilities
- [ ] Data export/import
- [ ] Training insights and visualizations
- [ ] Multiple training styles (hypertrophy, strength, hybrid)
- [ ] Equipment-based program filtering
- [ ] Mobile and desktop responsive design

### Future: SaaS Layer (Optional, Paid)
- Premium coaching features
- Advanced analytics
- Team/coach management
- Cloud sync across devices
- Community features and challenges

**Note:** The core application will always remain open source and free. SaaS features will be optional add-ons.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*To be determined during requirements phase with GitHub Copilot*

Considerations:
- Progressive Web App framework (React/Vue/Svelte + PWA plugins)
- Offline-first architecture (Service Workers, IndexedDB)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Modern, responsive UI/UX
- Local-first data storage

## 📋 Project Status

**Current Phase:** 🔨 Requirements & Planning

We're currently in the initial planning phase, working with GitHub Copilot to define detailed requirements and technical architecture.
